=head1 PERL+OPENMP WIKI

Welcome. The main thrust of this project is language exploration. In particular,
explore how to best leverage OpenMP (which is available on C<gcc> since 2005!)
within Perl.

=head1 CURRENT RESEACH GOAL

=over 4

=item Explore approaches to exposing OpenMP in C<Tie::*> interfaces for basic
Perlstructures (SCALAR, HASH, ARRAY)

=item Useful keyword implementations that do stuff using OpenMP

=item Other things .. (list it)

=back

=head1 REPOS OF EXPERIMENTAL THINGS

=over 4

=item Experimental C<Tie::OpenMP> interfaces

L<https://github.com/Perl-OpenMP/p5-Tie-OpenMP-Experimental>

=item Paralleized keywords

There is no repo yet for this, but the idea is to experiment with constructs
that I<look> like keywords. These are typically provided via I<prototypes>.

=item Pure fiction, nothing else:

L<https://github.com/oodler577/p5-fan-fiction>

Literally just exploring how to write threaded code. It probably doesn't make
sense and it probably doesn't compile. But it can be fun to write and read.
